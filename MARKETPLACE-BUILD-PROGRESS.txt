3. **Requests** - Users can request specific items

This unique combination makes Ne3ma stand out from competitors!

TESTING INSTRUCTIONS
===============================================================================

## BEFORE TESTING:
1. **Apply Database Schema:**
   - Open Supabase Dashboard
   - Go to SQL Editor
   - Run: marketplace-orders-schema.sql
   - Verify tables created successfully

2. **Restart Development Server:**
   - Server should be running on http://localhost:3001
   - If not, run: npm run dev

## TEST SCENARIOS:

### Test 1: Browse Businesses
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/shop
2. Should see tabs: All | Restaurants | Factories | Pharmacies
3. Click each tab → see filtered businesses
4. Each business card shows recent products
5. Check loading states work

### Test 2: Business Profile
1. Click on any business card
2. Should go to /business/[id]
3. See business header with logo and info
4. See all products from that business
5. Try category filters if multiple categories exist
6. Check "Order Now" buttons (will need product page next)

### Test 3: Check add-new-listing
1. Go to http://localhost:3001/add-new-listing
2. Check if it opens now
3. If errors, check browser console (F12)

===============================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES & FIXES NEEDED
===============================================================================

## 1. add-new-listing Not Opening
**Status:** Need to diagnose
**Next Steps:**
- Open page in browser
- Check console for errors
- Likely issue: GoogleSearch component or missing props

## 2. Navigation Updates Needed
**Current:** Header still says "Donate"
**Should Be:**
- "Shop" or "Browse" → goes to /shop
- "Donate/Request" → separate page for donations/requests

## 3. Product Detail Page
**Status:** Not built yet
**Priority:** HIGH - needed for order functionality

## 4. Existing Listings Need Migration
**Issue:** Old listings don't have listing_type field
**Fix:** SQL update already included in schema:
```sql
UPDATE listing SET listing_type = 'sale' WHERE price > 0;
UPDATE listing SET listing_type = 'donation' WHERE price = 0;
```
